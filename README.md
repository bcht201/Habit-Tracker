# Lap 3 Project

## For 3 days you will be working to create a habit tracker.

### User stories:
- As a user, I should be able to add a habit that I want to track
- As a user, I should be able to choose a habit that I have added to the list to track 
- As a user, I should be able to choose the frequency at which I want to track the habit, i.e. how often I want to see it on my list of uncompleted tasks
- As a user I should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete 
- As a user I should be able to see a list of completed habits for the day
- As a user I should be able to see if I have a streak of completing a specific habit

### Technical functionality:  
- Developers should locally host a database to store the daily information about users.
- CRUD capabilities
- The backend should be tested using a testing framework and functional, intreracting through an api testing tool.  

### STRETCH GOAL:
- have the functionality for a user to log in
- have the neccessary pages/views/forms to create, edit/update and delete habits.
